# Catalog of Million Degree Loops

The purpose of this catalog is to collect observations of coronal loops identified in AIA images (primarily 171 and 193) that also appear (cotemporally) in EIS observations.
This catalog consists of a set of loop coordinates stored in the `asdf` file format.
The coordinates are stored alongside information about the particular coordinate frame they were traced from.
We show these traced loops overlaid on top of the corresponding AIA and EIS images.
